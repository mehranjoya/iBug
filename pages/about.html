  <!-- About paragraph -->
  <p>This game is a 4x4 grid game where you have objects (bugs) in each square. The aim of the game is to click on the bugs, which will change colour, finding the <font color="red">Red</font> bug which will result to the game ending (player winning). The score is calculated by time in seconds and milliseconds. The quicker you find the red bug, the higher your score will be.</p>
